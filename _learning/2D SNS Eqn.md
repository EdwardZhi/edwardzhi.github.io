We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on a two-dimensional domain, driven by a spatially regular noise. Existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved separately by fixed-point iteration and Galerkin's approximation. Existence of invariant measures is shown by the Krylov-Bogoliubov theorem, and the coupling technique is invoked to show uniqueness of the invariant measure.
